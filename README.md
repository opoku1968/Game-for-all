Rock paper scissors is an hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player at the same time forms rock,paper, or scissors shapes by outstretching one's hand.
The rock is a closed fist, paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended   palm facing downward, and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player. Rock crushes scissors, and scissors cut through paper and  paper wrap around rock.
